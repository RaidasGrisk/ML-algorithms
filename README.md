# ML-algorithms

Just a few examples of simple algorithms I'm playing with while learning ML.

1. [**Multivariate regression**](/Multivariate_regression.py). Basic and simple implementation of multivariate regression. 
2. [**Logistic regression**](/Logistic_regression.py). The same as before. Simple logistic regression. 
3. C
4. D

1, 2 and 3 alogorithms are made based on Andrew's NG machine learning course on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
