# ML-algorithms

Just a few examples of algorithms I've tried with while learning ML.

1. [**Multivariate regression**](/Multivariate_regression.py). Basic and simple implementation of multivariate regression. 

2. [**Logistic regression**](/Logistic_regression.py). The same as before. Simple logistic regression. 

3. [**Simple neural network**](/Neural_network.py). Simple (yet terribly coded) neural network implemented using numpy only. This was my first take at trying to understand neural nets. No other functionalities (e.g dropout), except for regularization and variable hidden layers and neurons. At the time I wrote this I had rather shitty programming skills, so reading and trying to understand this code it quite agonizing (be warned).

4. [**Policy gradient**](/Policy_gradient_breakout.py). First take at reinforcement learning. Basic policy gradient implementation using tensorflow and Breakout from openAI's gym. I tried to keep it as simple as possible with only minor exceptions. Hopefully, this is easy to read and understand.

5. [**Deep Q Learning**](/DQN_Breakout.py). Second take at reinforcement learning. Basic DQN implementation using tensorflow and Breakout from openAI's gym.

1, 2 and 3 alogorithms are based on Andrew's NG machine learning course on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
