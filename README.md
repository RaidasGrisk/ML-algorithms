# ML-algorithms in practice

Few examples of algorithms I've tried with while learning ML. Hopefully it's easy to read and understand.

1. [**Policy gradient**](/Policy_gradient_breakout.py). First take at reinforcement learning. Basic policy gradient implementation using tensorflow and Breakout from openAI's gym. I tried to keep it as simple as possible with only minor exceptions. Hopefully, this is easy to read and understand.

2. [**Deep Q Network**](/DQN_Breakout.py). Second take at reinforcement learning. Basic DQN implementation using tensorflow and Breakout  from openAI's gym.


# Things implemented simply

The idea is to make everything simple and readable. Take a concept and implement it from scratch (numpy in this case). If you manage to do that, hopefully, that will help you to understand a thing or two about the concept.

1. [**Multivariate regression**](/Multivariate_regression.py). Simple implementation of multivariate regression. Optimized using gradient decent with regularization (lambda).

2. [**Logistic regression**](/Logistic_regression.py). The same as before. Simple logistic regression. 

3. [**Simple neural network**](/Neural_network_v2.py). Simple neural net (multilayer perceptron). Optimized using Adam algorithm, regularized using dropout.
