# ML-algorithms

Just a few examples of simple algorithms I'm playing with while learning ML.

1. [**Multivariate regression**](/Multivariate_regression.py). Basic and simple implementation of multivariate regression. Based on Andrew's NG machine learning course on Coursera.
2. [**Logistic regression**](/Logistic_regression.py). The same as before. Multivariate regression made into logistic one. Based on Andrew's NG machine learning course on Coursera.
