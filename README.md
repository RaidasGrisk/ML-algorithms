# ML-algorithms

Just a few examples of simple algorithms I've tried with while learning ML.

1. [**Multivariate regression**](/Multivariate_regression.py). Basic and simple implementation of multivariate regression. 

2. [**Logistic regression**](/Logistic_regression.py). The same as before. Simple logistic regression. 

3. **Simple neural network**(/Neural_network.py). Simple (yet terribly coded) neural network implemented with numpy only. This was a first take on trying to understand neural nets better. No other functionalities (e.g dropout), except for regularization and variable hidden layers and neurons. At the time I wrote this I had rather shitty programming skills, so reading and trying to understand this code it quite agonizing (be warned).

4. **Policy gradient**. First take at reinforcement learning. Basic policy gradient implementation using tensorflow. I tried to keep it as simple as possible with only minor exception. Hopefully, this is easy to read and understand.

5. **Deep Q Learning**

1, 2 and 3 alogorithms are based on Andrew's NG machine learning course on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
